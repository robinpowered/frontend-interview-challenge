# Robin Frontend Interview Challenge

Welcome!

Here you will find a set of problems to solve when interviewing with Robin. These problems represent real-world scenarios you can expect to encounter while working at Robin.

We do not expect you to spend more than an hour or two on these challenges.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

- NodeJS version 8+ [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once node is installed clone this repository. Please ensure all work is done on a new feature branch:
```
git checkout -b robin-challenge-solutions
```

```
npm install
```

## Challenges

The challenges are broken into two groups - functional programming challenges and UI component challenges.

Challenges can be found in the `challenges/` directory. Each challenge contains three files:

#### `challenge.js`

This is where you will implement the function, or component, to complete the challenge. The contents of this file are entirely up to you, the only requirement is that the function signature remains the same and remains exported.

#### `data.json`

This contains the mock data that will be used for the particular challenge. These are made up events, or multiple groups of events, depending on the challenge.

### Meeting Availability Challenge

Find the availabile time slots within a given schedule.

```js
findFreeTimes(start: Date, end: Date, duration: number, events: Array<Event>)
```

```

  end={endTime}
  duration={30}

```
