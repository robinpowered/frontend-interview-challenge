# Robin Front-end Interview Challenge

## Getting Started

To run things locally:

1. Install NodeJS 16+. If you have `nvm` installed, run `nvm use` from the root of the repository.
2. Create a new feature branch to store all your work:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b robin-challenge-solutions
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Boot up the test server & application scaffolding:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Challenge

You will be building a simple web app that fetches data from a remote server, transforms it, and outputs some UI.

Specifically, we ask that you:

1. Fetch JSON user data from the back-end server. For your convience, a simple webserver is started when you run the `npm start` command and is available at `http://localhost:8080/data`. When fetching data in your solution, you may simply perform a `GET` to `/data`.

The user data is an array of objects, where each item in the array represents an individual user, with properties for meetings they have on their schedule (`events`), when the user works (`working_hours`), and other metadata about the user (`user_id`, `user_name`).

```json

```

2. Find meetings that are within a user's working hours
3. Display the results in tabular form

### Parameters

* Please timebox your effort to 1-2 hours

### User data
